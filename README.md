Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:
Software engineering is the branch of computer science that deals with the design, development, testing, and maintenance of software applications. 

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software engineering applies scientific and mathematical principles to the design, analysis and implementation of software systems whereas traditional Programming on the other hand, is mainly concerned with writing code to solve specific problems.
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
 
Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
1. Planning & Analysis
The first phase of the SDLC is the project planning stage where you are gathering business requirements from your client or stakeholders. This phase is when you evaluate the feasibility of creating the product, revenue potential, the cost of production, the needs of the end-users, etc.
2. Define Requirements
This phase is critical for converting the information gathered during the planning and analysis phase into clear requirements for the development team. This process guides the development of several important documents: a software requirement specification.
3. Design
The design phase is where you put pen to paper—so to speak. The original plan and vision are elaborated into a software design document (SDD) that includes the system design, programming language, templates, platform to use, and application security measures. 
4. Development
The actual development phase is where the development team members divide the project into software modules and turn the software requirement into code that makes the product. 
5. Testing
Before getting the software product out the door to the production environment, it’s important to have your quality assurance team perform validation testing to make sure it is functioning properly and does what it’s meant to do. The testing process can also help hash out any major user experience issues and security issues. 
6. Deployment
During the deployment phase, your final product is delivered to your intended user. You can automate this process and schedule your deployment depending on the type.
7. Maintenance
The maintenance phase is the final stage of the SDLC if you’re following the waterfall structure of the software development process.
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Agile is open to adaptation, encourages experimentation and welcomes changes of direction, even in later phases of the project. Because of this, the budget tends to be more flexible. Waterfall is a linear project progression, so it's best suited for projects with a defined end goal.
Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Requirements engineering is the process of defining, documenting, and maintaining requirements. It involves activities like elicitation, analysis, specification, and verification to ensure software meets stakeholders' needs. Proper management improves project clarity, reduces errors, and aligns expectations. Software requirements provide the basis for practical testing. By having a complete and well-documented set of requirements, software engineers can create test cases that cover all aspects of the software they are developing. Testing helps ensure that the final product meets all customer expectations.
Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Modularity in software design is a technique where complex software is divided into smaller, independent modules, such as functions, classes, or components. It facilitates easier management and understanding of complex systems by breaking them down into digestible parts.
Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Unit Testing
1. Unit testing is the first level of testing. At this stage, developers test individual units of the system to make sure that they are usable. 
2. Integration Testing
During the Integration Testing, QA Engineers combine individual units and test them together as a group. The main purpose of this software testing level is to find bugs in the interaction of system units.
3. System Testing
System Testing is the phase where a tester checks a complete and fully integrated system as a whole. At this stage, QA Engineers integrate all units to verify whether the developed product works properly and meets the specified requirements. 
4. Acceptance Testing
Acceptance Testing is the last level of software testing that is carried out before the product goes live. Testers conduct this type of testing to help the customer evaluate the obtained result and check whether the system meets the acceptance criteria. 
Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Version control software keeps track of every modification to the code in a special kind of database. If a mistake is made, developers can turn back the clock and compare earlier versions of the code to help fix the mistake while minimizing disruption to all team members. Examples include Git, CVS, SVN.
Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
Software project manager's responsibilities are to analyze project constraints, establish the project objectives, coordinate the project's internal and external teams, construct the project timelines and monitor the project's key performance indicators. Challenges faced include: Not Enough Planning Ahead, Keeping up with the Latest Market Trends, Setting the bar too high, facing the skills gap.
Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Software maintenance is an integral part of the software life cycle that involves modifying and updating software after it has been deployed. The goal of maintenance is to correct faults, improve performance or other attributes, and adapt the software to a changing environment throughout its lifetime. Difference type of maintenance iclude: 
1. Corrective Software Maintenance
Corrective software maintenance is the typical, classic form of maintenance (for software and anything else for that matter). Corrective software maintenance is necessary when something goes wrong in a piece of software including faults and errors. 
2. Preventative Software Maintenance
Preventative software maintenance is looking into the future so that your software can keep working as desired for as long as possible. 
3. Perfective Software Maintenance
As with any product on the market, once the software is released to the public, new issues and ideas come to the surface. Users may see the need for new features or requirements that they would like to see in the software to make it the best tool available for their needs.
4. Adaptive Software Maintenance
Adaptive software maintenance has to do with the changing technologies as well as policies and rules regarding your software.
Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
Privacy, accuracy, property, accessibility, and effects on quality of life, are all issues that must be considered in developing and delivering computer software systems.With the increasing reliance on technology, protecting user data has become a pressing concern. By incorporating encryption, access controls, and other security measures, software engineers can safeguard user information from unauthorized access and potential data breaches.
